# Elon Musk vs Brad Pitt Classifier [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai) hosted  on [Render](https://render.com)

Based on the sample app https://fastai-v3.onrender.com, but with 2 celebrities instead of bears :). Just a fun little side project as I'm working through fast.ai material. 

The guide for production deployment to Render is at https://course.fast.ai/deployment_render.html.
